# Examples for the survey about proof scores

This repository contains the examples for the survey on proof scores. Each folder
contains examples for a different system. Note that, although the code for CafeOBJ
and CafeInMaude is the same, the proof scores are different: the ones for CafeInMaude
have identifiers in all open-close environments to identify them and later use other
tools.
